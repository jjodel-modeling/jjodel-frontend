## 2026-10-21 — ticket: JjEL: 0xFF evaluates silently to 0 (lenient parse drops trailing tokens)
**Ticket**: JjEL reads `0xFF` as the number `0` followed by the identifier `xFF`, and the lenient `parse()` keeps the first expression and drops the rest without an error (discovery `docs/discovery/discovery_2026-10-20_jjel_bitvector.md` §3.3; known defect in `docs/spec/concern_languages.md:102`, parse() does not check EOF). A hardware user writing a hex constant gets 0 silently. Expected: a parse error on trailing tokens, or hex/binary number literals; at minimum the error. Found by P-2026-10-20-2055.
**Priority**: medium
**Found in**: P-2026-10-20-2055

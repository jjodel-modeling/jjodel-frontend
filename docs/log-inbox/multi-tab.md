# log-inbox — lane «multi-tab»

Entries written by the multi-tab lanes (P9, parallel lanes). Whoever closes the batch moves them
into `docs/claude-code-log.md` **verbatim and in this order** (RC-12) and empties this file. The
active log is not touched by this lane.

## 2026-11-07 — fix: a model tab stops rewriting the viewpoint of the other open tabs
**Prompt**: lane L1 of multi-tab (R-MT-16): the mount-only restore of the saved viewpoint runs only for the dock's active tab; the preference is written by the picker, for its own model only
**Files touched**: frontend/src/components/abstract/tabs/EditorSwitch.tsx, frontend/src/components/editor-v2/Toolbar.tsx, frontend/src/components/abstract/tabs/__tests__/editorSwitchViewpointPrefs.test.ts (d9949895c)
**Outcome**: ⚠️ partial
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: (a)
**Regressions**: no
**Out-of-scope changes**: no
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required
**Smoke visivo**: passato (GO 2026-11-07, RC-23: scenes 1, 2, 3a, 4 FAIL on base, PASS after; 3b known gap, B's saved abstract syntax not restored, deferred to L2)
**Notes**: Test red 10/10, green 10/10; mutation bench kills the guard (1) and an id-blind active check (2); React wiring not executed by the bench (node, no DOM). Picker deps kept [modelId]: two source-text tests slice up to it. 3b: `!savedVpId` skips the '' preference, pre-existing and outside R-MT-16. Probe and outputs in ~/.jjodel-lanes/P-2026-11-07-0105/.
**Prompt document name**: 2026-11-07 01:05

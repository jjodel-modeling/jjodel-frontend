# log-inbox — lane «codegen»

Entries written by the code generation pilot lane on `codegen-pilot` (P9, parallel lanes). Whoever
closes the batch moves them into `docs/claude-code-log.md` **verbatim and in this order** (RC-12) and
empties this file. The active log is not touched by this lane.

## 2026-10-23 — ticket: the lazy gate's off mode is red since .env.production carries VITE_CODEGEN
**Ticket**: `npm run check:codegen-lazy` fails off clauses 0, 1 and 3 on any tree: the off build runs in production mode, and `.env.production` sets `VITE_CODEGEN = true` since 2046c17a3, so the build resolves the flag on whatever the process env says. Measured on the tip 478e5bc73 with `--off` (same three FAILs). The on mode stays green. Fix belongs to the gate or the env files, not to a codegen slice.
**Priority**: medium

## 2026-10-23 — feat(codegen): Code panel on M2, model chooser, no pill for consumers (P-2026-10-23-1910)
**Prompt**: Slice S1: the Code pill on an M2 canvas under the M1 rule (R-GEN-19), the panel on a metamodel with a chooser of conforming project models and an empty state, no pill in consumer mode (R-GEN-23), R-GEN-21 if time left
**Files touched**: frontend/src/codegen/setting.ts, frontend/src/codegen/__tests__/setting.test.ts, frontend/src/components/editor-v2/EditorV2.tsx, frontend/src/codegen/ui/CodePanel.tsx, frontend/src/codegen/ui/CodePanel.scss, frontend/src/codegen/ui/conformingModels.ts (new), frontend/src/codegen/ui/__tests__/conformingModels.test.ts (new), docs/log-inbox/codegen.md, docs/prompts/claude_2026-10-23_1910_prompt_codegen_s1_code_on_m2.md
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: unknown
**Out-of-scope changes**: no
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required
**Smoke visivo**: non applicabile
**Notes**: Inverts the committed «M1 only» pill row on purpose. R-GEN-21 done. SELECT_NODE keeps the editor id, not the target model (the report said otherwise; EditorV2 filters on its own id). Four mutants killed, bench in c192a4f5e. Lazy gate: on green, off red as on the tip (ticket above). No browser in this lane: DOM checks and crops are the chat's (RC-23), so Regressions stays unknown.

## 2026-10-23 — discovery: code generation authoring, Code on M2 and a Template Editor (P-2026-10-23-1840)
**Prompt**: Phase 1 read-only: how to open the Code panel on M2, a full Template Editor modelled on the JjTL one, two to four slices for Saturday to Monday, risks, provisional R-GEN rows; hard stop after the report
**Files touched**: docs/discovery/discovery_2026-10-23_codegen_authoring.md (new), docs/prompts/claude_2026-10-23_1840_prompt_template_editor_discovery.md (Status), docs/log-inbox/codegen.md
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no
**Out-of-scope changes**: no
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required
**Smoke visivo**: non applicabile
**Notes**: Code on M2 touches setting.ts, EditorV2 (CodegenSlot), CodePanel, no critical-zone file; JjEL has no Monaco language (jjtl is the only one, its completion provider is never registered). Four slices: S1 M2, S2 editor tab, S3 preview, S4 completion; cut S4 then S3. Provisional R-GEN-19..24 in the report, not in decisions.md. Nothing built or run in this lane.

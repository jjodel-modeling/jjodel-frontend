## 2026-09-30 — feat(views): edge ends, seven glyphs, Conditional ends, end roles, slice E (P-2026-09-30-1810)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-09-30_1810_prompt_edge_ends.md`, Phase 1 then 2 in cascade, heavy, on `~/jjodel-w-edgeends` branch `edge-ends` (from `viewpoint-notations` `30f3d8a81`): seven more edge ends, each end a Conditional resolved per instance, a multiplicity and a role per end, the line cut at the glyph's back, the panel grouped with Conditional ends and end labels in Advanced; no notation bound.
**Files touched**: report `77c2f946b` + §9 here: `docs/discovery/discovery_2026-09-30_edge_ends.md`. Code `8f3e7c307`: `viewpoint/ir/{irTypes,irValidate,irCompile,irEdgeViews}.ts`, `edges/edgeEndGlyphs.ts` (new), `edges/UnifiedEdge.tsx`, `utils/edgeUtils.ts`, `viewpoint/authoring/EdgeAuthoringPanel.tsx`, `EditorV2.scss`; tests `irEdgeEnds`, `irEdgeEndsRender`, `edgeEndGlyphs` (new), `irValidate`. Code `462fba92d`: `irCompile.ts`, two tests. This commit: report §9, `docs/decisions.md` (R-EE-1..4), this entry, the prompt's Status.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no — on `462fba92d`: typecheck exit 2, 14 errors, the §17 set; vitest 6255 passed, 0 failed, the 9 known files red at import; build exit 0. Red first on `77c2f946b`: 14 failed, 1 file at import; 9 markup pins taken there stay green. Mutation bench 22/23, the survivor equivalent.
**Out-of-scope changes**: no — 16 files, all in the report's §5 list (Rule 19, flagged there, RC-11); `EditorV2.scss` and `edgeEndGlyphs.ts` named by the report, as the prompt's DOVE asked.
**Layer Impact Report**: produced (report §6, in the Phase 1 commit before the first source edit)
**Smoke visivo**: passato (lane probe on 3093 16/16: 42 fixture links, light and dark, widths 1 and 2; the four demo scenes 0 px from the pre-edit shots) — chat, RC-23, pending; crops `frontend/scripts/smoke/_tmp_edgeends_crops/ee_fixture_w{1,2}_{light,dark}{,_new}_600.png`
**Notes**: Eight questions adopted as recommended, unattended (RC-21/RC-25), rows R-EE-1..4; Q2 (end labels widened to `TextSource | EdgeEndLabels`, R-VP-23 kept) verified by a second agent (RC-27), whose scratch folders in /tmp were removed. `bar` also names a ShapeForm (Q1). Tips stop on the handle's outer edge, as every IR arrow. Detail in the report §0, §9.

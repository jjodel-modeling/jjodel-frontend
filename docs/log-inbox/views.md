## 2026-09-27 — feat(editor-v2): metamodel canvas refuses connections to non-class nodes (P-2026-09-27-0120)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-09-27_0120_fase2_enum_edge_guard_canvas.md`, Phase 2 step C1 of the enum edge guard, `Lane: full`, on `~/jjodel-open` branch `enum-edge-guard`. Option A of report `4e5dff7ad` (R-EDGE-1): in a metamodel a canvas connection is valid only when both ends are class nodes; in a model nothing changes.
**Files touched**: code `5dc09a4ce`: `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/utils/connectionValidity.ts` (new), `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/utils/__tests__/connectionValidity.test.ts` (new), `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/EditorV2.tsx` (`isValidConnection` on `<ReactFlow>`, `getNode`, the import), `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/EditorV2.scss` (one rule, `--color-error`). This commit: this entry, two tickets, the Status lines of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 prompt files.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no. On `5dc09a4ce`: `npm run typecheck` exit 2, 14 errors, set identical to the baseline; `npx vitest run` 4936 passed (4889 + 47, stated before the run), 0 failed, the same 9 files red at import; `npm run build` exit 0, 51 warning lines; `check:docs` 4/4; `check:scripts` PASS. Red first: the test failed at collection. Mutation bench 6/6 killed, table in `5dc09a4ce` (mutant 5 by the browser probe). Probe on 3004: 51/51 in light and in dark.
**Out-of-scope changes**: no — the four files of the prompt's DOVE; `git diff --stat` of every other path empty.
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required (no `CLAUDE.md` §3.1 file touched)
**Smoke visivo**: passato — chat, unattended, 51/51 (Alfonso in the morning digest)
**Notes**: Declared at the hard stop: the prompt commit's parent is `931943f29` (the R-EDGE rows, docs only), not `90722c375`; subject cut to 72 (the prompt's was 76); port 3004, 3003 held by another server; the discovery's probe was gone, a new one written. The class node type is a literal typed by `ClassNodeType`: the registry cannot be imported. The first turn ended with gates in the background and no Outcome; resumed. Screenshots: `~/.jjodel-lanes/P-2026-09-27-0120/shots/`.
**Prompt document name**: 2026-09-27 01:20

**Ticket** (observations, low, not tickets of their own): (1) releasing a gesture exactly on an anchor's centre can hit its source twin, which has no `connectableend`, and xyflow refuses it before `isValidConnection` runs: measured on a reconnect at 100% with and without this lane (mutant-5 run), and on a connect at zoom 0.8. (2) In the dark L1 screenshot a node at x=1091 paints over the right panel's tree header; not in light; not investigated.

## 2026-09-27 — ticket: saved metamodels may hold the edges the canvas now refuses
**Ticket**: The canvas guard of `5dc09a4ce` stops new ones only. Projects saved before it may hold three shapes, each measured by the discovery to load, render and survive save and reload: S1, a `DReference` typed by a `DEnumerator` with its `isReference` DEdge (it also round-trips through the Ecore export and import); S5b, a raw `extends` on a `DEnumerator` with its `isExtend` DEdge (dropped silently by the export); S6, a `DReference` typed by a `DPackage` (its export does not re-import). Two options (R-EDGE-3): an M2 well-formedness producer in the problems registry (shows, repairs nothing; a new `NodeProblemKind` changes an exported union), or a VersionFixer migration that retypes to `EObject` and deletes the orphan DEdges and `DEnumerator.extends` (a migration and a deletion of persisted data: RC-26, Alfonso). The producer decision is taken at the closure of step C2, no later than 2026-10-04.
**Priority**: medium

## 2026-09-27 — ticket: step C2, the model layer and the Ecore import refuse a non-class type or supertype
**Ticket**: The canvas guard (C1, `5dc09a4ce`) leaves every other writer open: console and L API, custom view code, the Ecore import. Report §4 B: `LTypedElement.set_type` refuses, for a `DReference`, a pointer whose D object is not a `DClass`; `_canExtend` refuses a non-class superclass with a reason instead of dying on `.map`; the data types get a refusing `set_extends`, so `_defaultSetter` stops writing a raw `extends`; the rule lives in a pure module (the `nameLookup.ts` pattern). The import check: `LinkAllNamesToIDs` in `api/data.ts` retypes an `EReference` whose `eType` is an `EEnum` to `EObject` with a `Log.ww` (R-EDGE-2), next to the `extends` check at `:360-363`. A core change (Rule 5). The review's warning, a precondition of its Phase 2: a guard in `set_type` must not run on load, undo/redo or VersionFixer replay, or saved projects stop opening; measure those paths first.

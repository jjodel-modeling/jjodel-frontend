## 2026-10-02 — fix(editor-v2): IR node corners and shadow no longer clipped at rest (P-2026-10-01-2336)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-10-01_2336_prompt_ir_corner_clip.md`, fast lane, light tier, Phase 1 then Phase 2 in cascade on `~/jjodel-w-irclip` (branch `ir-corner-clip`). The corners of an IR rect symbol on an M1 node (an Activity action drawn as `rect`) were clipped at rest by the wrapper's `overflow: hidden`; the fix lifts the clip for every wrapper that hosts an IR shape. Q1 (one test added to the scope) answered by the chat as recommended.
**Files touched**: Phase 1 `8cd4adb69`: `docs/discovery/discovery_2026-10-01_ir_corner_clip.md`. Code `0070222d8`: `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/nodes/instanceNode.scss` (one rule and its comment), `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/nodes/__tests__/irSelectionRing.test.ts` (one test). This commit: the report addendum (section 6) and this entry. The Status line of the prompt file is left at `da eseguire`: the `status-flip` skill is reserved for the user, so the flip is owed to the chat.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no — gates on `0070222d8`: `npm run typecheck` exit 2, 14 errors, the §17 set by file and code; `npx vitest run src/components/editor-v2` 105 files, 2559 tests, exit 0; `npm run build` exit 0. The one committed test that pinned the old rest state was changed on purpose (see Out-of-scope changes). The four default scenes and the two metamodel tabs 0 px from the before run; a census of 20 nodes finds nothing drawn past the wrapper's box at rest.
**Out-of-scope changes**: yes — `irSelectionRing.test.ts`, one test, not listed in the prompt: `expect(rgb).toEqual(CANVAS)` for an unselected IR node failed once the resting shadow showed (240,244,248 against 241,245,249). Added to the scope by the chat's ratified answer to Q1; the ring tests are untouched, mutation bench 1/1. Every other path is as the prompt listed.
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required (no §3.1 file touched)
**Smoke visivo**: chat (pending), lane probe on 3077, light, DPR 2: before run 49/49, after run 103/103; crops `sips -Z 600` in `frontend/scripts/smoke/_tmp_irclip_crops/` (gitignored): `ic_triptych_<label>_600.png` [before rest | after rest | after selected] per form, `ic_before_triptych_*` the defect, `ic_after_hover_*` the anchors.
**Notes**: Reading confirmed on 19 nodes. Corrections: no M2 IR node exists (IRNodeContent renders only in ObjectNode); radius 7 and up and the Activity action at 14 keep their corners but lost the shadow. irSelectionRing.test.ts pinned the old rest state: stopped with a question, scope added by the chat. Anchors on hover now draw whole (accepted). Report with addendum: docs/discovery/discovery_2026-10-01_ir_corner_clip.md.
**Prompt document name**: 2026-10-01 23:36

**Ticket** (observation, low, not a ticket of its own): the Chromium-laid-out vitest files (`irSelectionRing`, `irCollapsedRender`, `irActivityRender`, `irC2Render`) time out (hook 10 s, test 15 s) when the machine load is above about 25; a gate run in that state reads red without an assertion failing. `lane-run probe` also met a cold-server flake twice ("Failed to fetch dynamically imported module", "Execution context was destroyed"), absorbed by a warm-up in the probe, not in the app.

## 2026-10-02 — merge: ir-corner-clip into alfonso-frontend-jjtl (P-2026-10-02-1501)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-10-02_1501_prompt_merge_ir-corner-clip.md`, a merge in a session (`lane-run merge --direct` fell back: a union hunk edits a base section of `docs/log-inbox/views.md`): `ir-corner-clip` at `50d87c3ba` into `alfonso-frontend-jjtl`, merge base `4b9bc5836`, 5 commits on the branch side.
**Files touched**: merge `3db161e62`: 5 files from the branch side (`docs/discovery/discovery_2026-10-01_ir_corner_clip.md`, `docs/log-inbox/views.md`, `docs/prompts/claude_2026-10-01_2336_prompt_ir_corner_clip.md`, `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/nodes/__tests__/irSelectionRing.test.ts`, `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/nodes/instanceNode.scss`); this commit: this entry and the Status of the prompt file.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no. Gates on `3db161e62`: typecheck 14, the §17 set; typecheck:scripts exit 0; vitest 6457 in 260 files (the trunk tip's 6457 in 260, the branch adds no test: `irSelectionRing.test.ts` counts 5 on both sides), 0 failed, the 9 known files red at import; hooks 344; build exit 0; check:docs 4/4; check:agents, check:scripts and check:addonly PASS.
**Out-of-scope changes**: no. 5 files, all from the branch side, listed above; the merge is the prompt's scope.
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required
**Smoke visivo**: passato — chat, unattended: the lane's crops checked before the merge (rect 4 and the derived action as rect: corners whole at rest, resting shadow, rest and selected differ by ring and band only, hover anchors whole); the merge shares no code file with the trunk side
**Notes**: Union in `docs/log-inbox/views.md`: the trunk's preamble, then the branch's entry P-2026-10-01-2336 and its ticket paragraph; the base's 80 entries, folded by `d2eb5fb83` and byte-identical in the log and its archive, not carried back. No rollback tag, pre-merge tip `eaead2d71`. The session started with nvm node v18 first on PATH (trunk tip 277 red there); gates ran on `~/.hermes/node/bin` v26.8.1. The tip then moved by `0be127357`, docs only.

## 2026-09-30 — feat(views): edge ends, seven glyphs, Conditional ends, end roles, slice E (P-2026-09-30-1810)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-09-30_1810_prompt_edge_ends.md`, Phase 1 then 2 in cascade, heavy, on `~/jjodel-w-edgeends` branch `edge-ends` (from `viewpoint-notations` `30f3d8a81`): seven more edge ends, each end a Conditional resolved per instance, a multiplicity and a role per end, the line cut at the glyph's back, the panel grouped with Conditional ends and end labels in Advanced; no notation bound.
**Files touched**: report `77c2f946b` + §9 here: `docs/discovery/discovery_2026-09-30_edge_ends.md`. Code `8f3e7c307`: `viewpoint/ir/{irTypes,irValidate,irCompile,irEdgeViews}.ts`, `edges/edgeEndGlyphs.ts` (new), `edges/UnifiedEdge.tsx`, `utils/edgeUtils.ts`, `viewpoint/authoring/EdgeAuthoringPanel.tsx`, `EditorV2.scss`; tests `irEdgeEnds`, `irEdgeEndsRender`, `edgeEndGlyphs` (new), `irValidate`. Code `462fba92d`: `irCompile.ts`, two tests. This commit: report §9, `docs/decisions.md` (R-EE-1..4), this entry, the prompt's Status.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no — on `462fba92d`: typecheck exit 2, 14 errors, the §17 set; vitest 6255 passed, 0 failed, the 9 known files red at import; build exit 0. Red first on `77c2f946b`: 14 failed, 1 file at import; 9 markup pins taken there stay green. Mutation bench 22/23, the survivor equivalent.
**Out-of-scope changes**: no — 16 files, all in the report's §5 list (Rule 19, flagged there, RC-11); `EditorV2.scss` and `edgeEndGlyphs.ts` named by the report, as the prompt's DOVE asked.
**Layer Impact Report**: produced (report §6, in the Phase 1 commit before the first source edit)
**Smoke visivo**: passato (lane probe on 3093 16/16: 42 fixture links, light and dark, widths 1 and 2; the four demo scenes 0 px from the pre-edit shots) — chat, RC-23, pending; crops `frontend/scripts/smoke/_tmp_edgeends_crops/ee_fixture_w{1,2}_{light,dark}{,_new}_600.png`
**Notes**: Eight questions adopted as recommended, unattended (RC-21/RC-25), rows R-EE-1..4; Q2 (end labels widened to `TextSource | EdgeEndLabels`, R-VP-23 kept) verified by a second agent (RC-27), whose scratch folders in /tmp were removed. `bar` also names a ShapeForm (Q1). Tips stop on the handle's outer edge, as every IR arrow. Detail in the report §0, §9.

## 2026-10-02 — merge: alfonso-frontend-jjtl into edge-ends, slice E synced with the trunk (P-2026-10-02-1505)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-10-02_1505_prompt_edge_ends_trunk_sync.md`, Phase 1 then 2 in cascade, heavy, on `~/jjodel-w-edgeends` branch `edge-ends`: the trunk into slice E before its merge, both intents kept, gates at baseline (RC-14).
**Files touched**: report `b7d0885e9` + §7 here: `docs/discovery/discovery_2026-10-02_edge_ends_trunk_sync.md`. Merge `1e1ce1334` of `eaead2d71`, resolved: `edges/UnifiedEdge.tsx`, `viewpoint/ir/irEdgeViews.ts`, `docs/log-inbox/views.md`. Fix `9e1f9fae5`: `edges/UnifiedEdge.tsx`, `viewpoint/ir/__tests__/irEdgeEndsRender.test.ts`; `119046cb2`: the same test file. This entry, the prompt's Status.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no — typecheck exit 2, 14 errors, the §17 set; vitest 6502/6503, 11 files red: the 9 known at import, `irSelectionRing.test.ts` and `traceMonitor.test.ts` green alone (load); build exit 0; `check:scripts` PASS; mutation benches: the fix 9/9, slice E 22/23 (T13 equivalent). `check:addonly` red on the merge only, inherited from `d2eb5fb83` (report §7).
**Out-of-scope changes**: no — the merge, the two code files resolved as the report says, and the fix the report names (Q3) with its tests, in separate `fix:` commits (DOVE).
**Layer Impact Report**: produced (report §4, in the Phase 1 commit; no §3.2 file in any resolution)
**Smoke visivo**: passato (lane probe on 3095, light: base 5/5 on the `c3a9c9ffd` code, after 20/20; the four demo scenes and DemoFlowB as Activity (UML) byte-identical to base, bars 7×120 painted 5×118, every flow on the open arrowhead; slice E's fixture at widths 1 and 2) — chat, RC-23, pending; crops `frontend/scripts/smoke/_tmp_ee_sync_crops/`
**Notes**: Q1-Q3 adopted as recommended (RC-21): `eaead2d71` merged pinned, the trunk moving to `7de984795` meanwhile (the next merge meets only a `views.md` union); `views.md` = the trunk preamble + the slice E entry; the junction trunk takes its own new-end marker. `check:addonly` flags the merge only: 172 entries, all 185 that leave the inboxes verbatim in the log or archive (ticket below). Detail in the report §0, §7.

## 2026-10-02 — ticket: check:addonly refuses a fold and a rotation in one commit, and every trunk merge across it
**Ticket**: `check:addonly` explains an inbox entry that disappears only by the active log of the same commit, never by the archive. The trunk's `d2eb5fb83` (P-2026-10-01-2344) folded the inboxes and rotated the log in one commit, so `npm run check:addonly -- d2eb5fb83` fails on the trunk itself. Every merge of the trunk into a branch that still carries the pre-fold inboxes fails the same way, measured on `1e1ce1334`: 172 entries flagged, all verbatim in the archive. Either the archive joins the inbox pool, or fold and rotation stay two commits.
**Priority**: medium

## 2026-10-02 — merge: edge-ends takes alfonso-frontend-jjtl, slice E on the trunk before its own merge (P-2026-10-02-1641)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-10-02_1641_prompt_edge-ends_take_trunk.md`, rendered by `lane-run merge --trunk-into`, full lane on `~/jjodel-w-edgeends` branch `edge-ends`: the trunk `alfonso-frontend-jjtl` at `adb5d9731` into the branch with one `--no-ff` merge, merge base `eaead2d71`, before the branch's own merge into the trunk (RC-14).
**Files touched**: merge `0c221f237`: 18 files from the trunk side (`docs/decisions.md`, two discovery reports, five prompts, `docs/log-inbox/{jjscript,symbol-editor,views}.md`, `nodes/instanceNode.scss`, `authoring/LabelEntryEditor.tsx`, `ir/irCompile.ts`, `ir/irLabelEdit.ts` and three tests), `views.md` resolved by union. This commit: this entry and the prompt's Status.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no — gates on `0c221f237`: typecheck exit 2, 14 errors, the §17 set; typecheck:scripts exit 0; vitest 6542/6542 in 264 files, 0 failed, the 9 known files red at import (expected: 6496 at `adb5d9731` plus the 46 the branch adds); hooks 344/344; build exit 0; check:docs 4/4; check:scripts and check:addonly PASS.
**Out-of-scope changes**: no — 18 files, above five (RC-11), all from the trunk side, the merge being the prompt's scope; the one hand resolution is `views.md`, by the union of COME 4.
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required (no §3.2 file; `irCompile.ts`, under `viewpoint/ir/`, auto-merged with disjoint hunks, no hand edit)
**Smoke visivo**: passato — chat GO, unattended, on the report and the slice E probes of P-2026-10-02-1505 (20/20); no probe re-run on `0c221f237`; Alfonso in the morning digest.
**Notes**: Union in `views.md`: preamble, the trunk's two entries, the branch's three, verbatim. `decisions.md` auto-merged (R-IRN-38, Serie R-EE): base plus each side's hunk. Trunk count from P-2026-10-02-1642's `vitest-before.json` on `adb5d9731`: `jjodel-release` moved to `abb05cb9f` (pastel, code) mid-lane, its gates running. `merge-tree HEAD abb05cb9f`: 1 conflict, `views.md`, for the merge into the trunk.

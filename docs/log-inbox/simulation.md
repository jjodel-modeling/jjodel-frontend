# log-inbox — lane «simulation»

Entries written by the simulation lane on `simulation-engine` (slice 0), moved here verbatim from
the three log-entry commits that were not cherry-picked (`22a593315`, `960de31d8`, `baf7b2b8a`,
reachable from the tag `archive/simulation-engine-2026-09-14`). Whoever closes the batch moves them
into `docs/claude-code-log.md` **verbatim and in this order** (RC-12) and empties this file
(P9, P-2026-09-19-1740 addendum item 2).

## 2026-10-02 — discovery: the simulator's state UI, R-SIM-102..107 and 109 (P-2026-10-02-2340)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-10-02_2340_prompt_discovery_sim_state_ui.md`, heavy tier, read-only on `~/jjodel-w-simstate`, branch `sim-state-disc`: where the inspector docks, the `.smv` preview, «Written by»/«Read by», kept configurations, viewer preferences, the «Data» label, the demo per lane; a Phase 2 plan of at most three lanes.
**Files touched**: `docs/discovery/discovery_2026-10-02_sim_state_ui.md` (new), the Status line of the prompt, this entry.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no (docs only; the benches are gitignored `_tmp_*` under `frontend/scripts/smoke/`)
**Out-of-scope changes**: no
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required
**Smoke visivo**: non applicabile
**Notes**: Benches on the four demo exports reproduce the script's readings word for word. Kept configurations about 100 B each (100 KiB for 1000), 3.2 KB on a 62-global σ; replay 3-13 µs a step, equal to live 4/4; the trace lacks input values. Inspector: a floating card beside the panel. Preview dropped. Lanes A ∥ B, then C. Report §0, §8.
**Prompt document name**: 2026-10-02 23:40

## 2026-10-03 — feat: the State page of the roles dialog and the model's State dialog (P-2026-10-03-0041)
**Prompt**: `claude_2026-10-03_0041_prompt_sim_state_dialog.md`, heavy tier, Phase 2 Lane B on `~/jjodel-w-simdialog`, branch `sim-state-dialog`: report §8.2 as R-SIM-109 adopts it, R-SIM-103 and R-SIM-102 in the dialogs; tests first; visual check by the chat, then its two fixes (kind chip colours, Globals once in the model dialog).
**Files touched**: code `b8ac89fcd`: `frontend/src/components/editor-v2/sim/SimRolesModal.tsx`, `SimRolesModal.scss`, `SimDataModal.tsx`, `simRoleStatus.ts`, `simStateUsage.ts` (new), `__tests__/simRoleStatus.test.ts`, `__tests__/simStateUsage.test.ts` (new); fix `a57092326`: `SimRolesModal.tsx`, `SimRolesModal.scss`. Demo `0889e83be`, `b4b32bd72`: `docs/demo/models_2026_simulator_demo.md`. This commit: the Status line of the prompt, this entry.
**Outcome**: ✅ completed
**Corregge**: —
**Causa**: —
**Regressions**: no. Typecheck 14 errors, the §17 set diffed by file and code; sim suites 395/395 (red first: 4 failed and a missing module); build exit 0, chunk-size warning only; probe readings after Reset as the script's (`Marking: locked · coins = 0, paid = false`, `Marking: i0 · count = 0`). Full vitest not run: the prompt names the sim suites.
**Out-of-scope changes**: yes — no file outside DOVE (ten files over five commits, above five, DOVE taken as the confirmation), but two typecheck logs were first written to `/tmp`, outside the worktree, then moved into the gitignored `frontend/scripts/smoke/`.
**Layer Impact Report**: not-required
**Smoke visivo**: passato — chat, unattended: chat RC-23 on the fresh crops, GO 2026-10-03 (State page two columns with the one-way arrow, E-NODE before Apply, Written by/Read by on ESM and Flow B, DEFINE indigo and IVAR amber chips, concrete chips dashed pink, model dialog with Globals once), after two fixes asked on the first crops; lane probe on 3064, light, 1600×1000, 78/78; crops `docs/discovery/harness/_tmp_simdialog_*.png`, gitignored
**Notes**: Both dialogs 1120×600. Mutation bench 21/21. The hexes the check named for DEFINE and IVAR exist only as component literals; the entity tokens used resolve to #EBE6FC/#5A4A7F and #F3E8D3/#6B5110. Commit type `feat` chosen: the prompt names none (P6). The first closure commit 263a2cdf0 was taken back with a soft reset and is replaced by this one. The role selects span the wide dialog. One console error at page load.
**Prompt document name**: 2026-10-03 00:41
**Ticket** (P-2026-10-03-0041): the probe kit's walk (`~/.jjodel-lanes/probe-kit/simgate/_tmp_simgate_walk.ts`, `semanticType`) looks for the R-SIM-97 Semantic type field; this tree has R-SIM-99's Simulation toggle and the picker, so the lane probe drives those instead (`frontend/scripts/smoke/_tmp_simdialog_probe.ts`, gitignored).
